# Strata London - Fontastic Talk

## Intoduction - 1 min

Nischal, Raghotham

## Fontastic - 4 mins

- What is DL 4 humans? & Projects we envision

- Background story of why we started this - pydata london etc 
- Goal 
  - build a classifier
  - showcase how would the model differentiate fonts

## Acquiring data & challenges for such projects - 3 mins

Things we tried

- scrape font squirrel - not enough images
- scrape other websites - not relevant fonts (old fonts)
- generate images locally with PIL

## Generate Images Locally - 3 mins

- How?
- Problems of overfitting?
- How did we solve this?

## Building Model - 5 mins

- Showcase our pretrained pytorch resnet model results
- talk a bit about LR finder & how we could achieve such results

## CNN Viz - 5 mins

- Showcase gradcam analysis of few different font images with different layers



## How did we work together to work towards this - 2 mins

- Remote work, async work, modern day collaboration tools like notion / zoom call / GH

## Optional - 2 mins

- Showcase darknet training from scratch
- Its CNN viz
- Show how to use deep learning on any topic using FastAI to get decent results (basically the fastAI notebook)
